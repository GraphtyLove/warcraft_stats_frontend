# Warcraft Stats - Front end

Warcraft Stat is a web-site that allow you to track best players' statistics on their character.

It has been developed to facilitate the tedious process of wondering which stats pros are prioritizing on their class.

## Project

This repo is only the front-end, you can find the back-end (an API rest made with python: FastApi) in the link bellow.

**[BACK END](https://github.com/GraphtyLove/warcraft_stats_api)**

## Features

You can switch between raid and mythic plus to track the list of top raiders or mm+ players.
In raid mode, you can select a specific boss.

You can specify which class/spec you want to target.

**⚠️ There is no guarantee that the character will be wearing his raid/mm+ stuff at the time we check. It could also be that the character is in another spec at the inspection time. ⚠️**
